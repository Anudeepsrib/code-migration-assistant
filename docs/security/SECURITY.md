## Security Philosophy

The Code Migration Assistant follows a **zero-trust, defense-in-depth** architecture built on three principles:

### 1. Zero Code Execution

All analysis is performed using Python's `ast` module (Abstract Syntax Tree parsing). **No user-supplied code is ever executed.** This eliminates the most dangerous class of injection attacks — remote code execution — by design.

### 2. Defense in Depth

Every request passes through multiple independent security layers before touching the filesystem:

```
User Input → Input Validation → Path Sanitization → Rate Limiting → AST-Only Analysis → Audit Logging
```

A failure in any single layer does not compromise the system because every subsequent layer independently enforces its own constraints.

### 3. Audit Everything

Every file access, migration event, and security-relevant action is logged to immutable, append-only JSON structured logs with compliance metadata for GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC2.

## Security Controls

### Input Validation

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/input_validator.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Forbidden keywords | `eval`, `exec`, `__import__`, `open`, `globals()`, `locals()` |
| Forbidden modules | `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `socket`, `urllib`, `http`, `ftplib`, `smtplib` |
| File size limit | 10 MB max (`SafeCodeAnalyzer.MAX_FILE_SIZE`) |
| Line count limit | Configurable (`SafeCodeAnalyzer.MAX_LINES`) |
| Syntax validation | All code must parse via `ast.parse()` |
| Pattern matching | Regex-based detection of dangerous constructs |

### Path Sanitization

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/path_sanitizer.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Traversal prevention | Blocks `../`, `..\\`, and encoded variants |
| Canonicalization | Resolves symlinks and relative paths to absolute |
| Extension whitelist | `.py`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.html`, `.css`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.md`, `.txt`, `.xml`, `.sql`, `.env` |
| Path length limit | 4096 characters max |
| Base path enforcement | All paths must resolve within the allowed project directory |

### Code Sandbox

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/code_sandbox.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| AST-only analysis | `ast.parse()` + `ast.walk()` — no `eval`, no `exec` |
| Resource limits | Configurable timeout and memory limits |
| Complexity metrics | Cyclomatic and cognitive complexity calculation |
| Safe error handling | Malformed code returns structured error, never crashes |

### Secrets Detection

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/secrets_detector.py`

| Capability | Details |
|------------|---------|
| Pattern library | 20+ patterns for API keys, passwords, tokens, certificates, connection strings |
| Severity levels | CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW |
| Context analysis | Reports surrounding lines for manual review |
| Compliance mapping | Each finding tagged with relevant regulation (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) |

### Cryptographic Operations

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/crypto_handler.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Atomic file writes | Write-then-rename prevents partial corruption |
| Integrity verification | SHA-256 checksums on all checkpoints |
| Automatic backups | Created before any file modification |
| Permission preservation | Original file permissions maintained on write |

### Audit Logging

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/audit_logger.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Format | Structured JSON (`.jsonl`), machine-readable |
| Compliance fields | GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2 metadata on every event |
| Rotation | `RotatingFileHandler`, 50 MB max per file, 10 backups |
| Retention | Configurable (default 90 days) |
| Log search | Query by time range, user, event type |
| Tamper protection | Append-only files with hash verification |

### Rate Limiting

**Module:** `src/code_migration/core/security/rate_limiter.py`

| Control | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Algorithm | Token bucket |
| Granularity | Per-operation limits (migrations, file ops, analysis) |
| Thread safety | Lock-protected concurrent access |
| Abuse detection | Automatic blocking on pattern violations |

---

## Threat Model

### Threat Matrix

| # | Threat | Risk | Mitigation | Controls |
|---|--------|------|------------|----------|
| 1 | **Code injection** | Malicious code executed via user input | AST-only parsing; forbidden keyword/module detection | `input_validator.py`, `code_sandbox.py` |
| 2 | **Path traversal** | Access files outside the project directory | Path canonicalization + base directory enforcement | `path_sanitizer.py` |
| 3 | **Information disclosure** | Sensitive data exposed in logs or output | Data anonymization; secrets detection; PII masking | `secrets_detector.py`, `audit_logger.py`, `anonymizer.py` |
| 4 | **Denial of service** | Resource exhaustion via large/complex inputs | Rate limiting; file size/line count limits; timeouts | `rate_limiter.py`, `code_sandbox.py` |
| 5 | **Data corruption** | Partial or incorrect file modifications | Atomic write-rename; SHA-256 checksums; auto-backups | `crypto_handler.py`, rollback engine |

### Attack Vector Examples

**Input injection (blocked):**
```python
eval('malicious_code()')        # Forbidden keyword
exec('system("rm -rf /")')      # Forbidden keyword
__import__('os').system('...')   # Forbidden module
```

**Path traversal (blocked):**
```python
"../../../etc/passwd"              # Traversal via ../
"..\\..\\windows\\system32\\sam"   # Windows traversal
"~/.ssh/id_rsa"                    # Home directory access
```

**Resource exhaustion (mitigated):**
```python
# Large files (>10 MB)             → Rejected by MAX_FILE_SIZE
# Complex files (>MAX_LINES)       → Rejected by line count check
# Long-running analysis (>timeout) → Killed by pytest-timeout / rate limiter
```

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. Always use the latest release — security patches are applied promptly
2. Review audit logs periodically for unusual activity
3. Create checkpoints before major migrations
4. Run compliance scans before and after migration
5. Report anything suspicious

### For Contributors

1. Security is a first-class design constraint, not an afterthought
2. Never trust user input — validate everything
3. Use `PathSanitizer` for all file operations
4. Write security tests for every new feature
5. See the [Contributing Guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#security-requirements) for the full security review checklist

### For CI/CD

1. Run `bandit -r src/code_migration/` in the pipeline
2. Run `pytest tests/security/` on every PR
3. Use `pip-audit` to catch dependency vulnerabilities
4. Enable strict markers to prevent test configuration drift
